# Overview
This Application is text_Demon_King
This is a text based rpg made completely in the programming language Java, I used Classes, extended classes, separate files, methods,
and much more to develop this text based game. This game includes 9 different enemies to fight, weapons to collect, shields to collect,
and a shop so you can collect said weapons, shields, and upgrades on health. The goal of this RPG is to defeat the Demon King. Think you
Can do it?

This may have been the hardest project for me so far, since I dived deep into a brandnew language that I was not at all familar with, while
improvements on the code could be expounded on, this is my first take in using this language and I am happy with the result.

While studying and learning this language, it honestly motivated me to push forward to work on possible future projects.

# Future Work

* Getting Better at analyzing how long an idea might take within a deadline.
* Get better and Java and other languages of interest.
* Continue development in my own personal projects, so I can continue to improve.
